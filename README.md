Android Template
---
This is a sample app that is developed to showcase MVVM architecture for Android with
Repository pattern and Offline-First strategy.

**NOTE** It is a relatively more complex and in progress architecture example so if you are not familiar
with [Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/arch), you are highly recommended to check other examples
in their repository first.

Introduction

### Functionality
The app is structured with best practices and guidelines which showcases use of:
* Android Framework with Java + Kotlin
* Repository pattern with offline-first strategy
* MVVM architectural pattern
* Android Architecture Components
* Dependency injection using Dagger 2
* Network and API call using Retrofit 2
* Database using Room Architecture Component

**NOTE** The app architecture is still in progress.
